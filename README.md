## Overview

### The website

You can visit my website [here](https://pizzeria-u-karola.netlify.app/).

##My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS
- Sass 7-1
- BEM Methodology
- Flexbox / CSS Grid
- OOP Modern JavaScript
- ESLint (airbnb) & Prettier
- ES Modules
- Parcel (with Babel)

### Continued development

I will improve this solution in the future based on your suggestions and testing.

### Known bugs

- The website doesn't display properly on older browsers (IE 9), the possible solution is to change `gap` properties to margins or set fallback paddings
- The gallery doesn't work on older browsers (IE9), this is probably because of the library I used.
